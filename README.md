A real-time chat application is a software application that enables users to exchange messages and communicate with each other in real-time. It allows individuals or groups to have conversations, share information, and collaborate instantly over the Internet.

Real-time chat applications are designed to provide a responsive and interactive experience, where messages are delivered and displayed immediately as they are sent. This means that users can engage in conversations and receive updates in real-time, without significant delays.
